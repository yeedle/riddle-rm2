# riddle — the diary of Tom Riddle, for the reMarkable Paper Pro

Write on the page with your pen. After a pause, the diary **drinks your ink** —
your words fade into the paper — the page thinks for a moment, and an answer
writes itself back in a flowing hand, stroke by stroke, then fades away.

No screen glow, no keyboard, no chat UI. Just ink appearing on paper.

_This is the diary from [the demo](https://x.com/MaximeRivest)._

### 🪄 New to this? Start here

You need a **reMarkable Paper Pro** in developer mode with a launcher installed.
If that sounds like a lot, it isn't — **[remagic](https://github.com/maximerivest/remagic)**
walks you through turning on developer mode and sets up everything with one
command. Come back here, drop riddle in, and start writing to Tom.

Already have xovi + AppLoad? Install from the [remagic](https://github.com/maximerivest/remagic)
catalog, [grab the prebuilt bundle](#install-the-prebuilt-bundle), or
[build from source](#building).

### Install with remagic (easiest)

```sh
remagic install riddle     # checksum-verified download → AppLoad
remagic config riddle      # settings form in your browser (+ QR for phone)
```

Then in **AppLoad**: tap **Reload**, then **The Diary**. Write, and rest your
pen. (Or install it from the **Store** app right on the tablet.)

### Install the prebuilt bundle

1. Grab `riddle-<version>.zip` from the [latest release](https://github.com/MaximeRivest/riddle/releases/latest)
   and unzip it into a folder: `unzip riddle-*.zip -d riddle`
2. Copy the folder to your tablet:
   `scp -O -r riddle root@10.11.99.1:/home/root/xovi/exthome/appload/`
3. Add an API key: `cp oracle.env.example oracle.env` in that folder and put your `RIDDLE_OPENAI_KEY` in it (any OpenAI-compatible key). Or skip it to use [pi](#option-b--pi-the-power-path).
4. In **AppLoad**: tap **Reload**, then **The Diary**. Write, and rest your pen.

## reMarkable 2 — SSH access and compatibility notes

The project was built and tested on the **reMarkable Paper Pro**. Running it on a
**reMarkable 2** is possible with some adjustments; this section covers the differences.

### SSH access on reMarkable 2 (simpler than Paper Pro)

Unlike the Paper Pro, the reMarkable 2 **does not require developer mode** to expose SSH
credentials — they are visible right away:

1. Open the menu (three horizontal lines, top-left corner).
2. Go to **Settings → Help → Copyrights and licenses**.
3. Scroll to the **GPLv3 Compliance** section at the bottom — your username (`root`),
   password, and IP addresses are listed there.

Connect over USB (the device always appears as `10.11.99.1` when plugged in):

```sh
ssh root@10.11.99.1
```

WLAN SSH is disabled by default. Once connected via USB, enable it with:

```sh
rm-ssh-over-wlan on
```

After that you can connect wirelessly using the WLAN IP shown in the same GPLv3 section.
To copy files to the tablet (same path as Paper Pro):

```sh
scp -O -r riddle root@10.11.99.1:/home/root/xovi/exthome/appload/
```

> 💡 **Tip:** To avoid typing the password each time, copy your SSH public key to the
> device with `ssh-copy-id root@10.11.99.1` after your first connection.

### Display backend on reMarkable 2

- **Windowed mode (AppLoad/qtfb)** — the recommended path for rM2.
  [xovi + AppLoad](https://github.com/asivery/rm-appload) supports the reMarkable 2, and
  the binary cross-compiled for `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu` matches both devices. Build
  normally with `cargo build --release --target aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu` and follow the
  standard AppLoad install.
- **Takeover mode (quill)** — depends on `libqsgepaper.so` pulled from *your own device*.
  The vendor library exists on the reMarkable 2 but targets a different board variant; the
  shim *may* work, but it has **not** been tested on rM2. Start with the windowed backend
  and switch to takeover only if you need lower latency.

> ⚠️ Hardware differences (display waveform tables, evdev event paths) between the
> reMarkable 2 and the Paper Pro may still require minor tuning. Keep SSH access live as
> your escape hatch at all times.

## How it works

```
 pen (raw evdev, full 4096-level pressure, hardware event rate)
   │ strokes
   ▼
 riddle ── idle 2.8s → commit page → PNG ──► oracle (resident LLM process,
   │                                          streams reply sentence-by-sentence)
   ▼ strokes (Dancing Script → skeletonized to single-pixel pen paths)
 display backend
   ├── qtfb        — windowed, inside xochitl (AppLoad app)
   └── quill       — full takeover: xochitl stopped, vendor e-ink engine
                     driven directly for instant ink (lowest latency there is)
```

- **`riddle/`** — the app (Rust). Pen input, ink surface, handwriting
  synthesis (rasterize → Zhang-Suen thinning → stroke tracing → animated
  replay), the oracle process manager, and both display backends.
- **`quill/`** — the takeover display host (C/C++). An
  [epfb-re](https://github.com/asivery/epfb-re)-style QImage-constructor
  interposition shim over the vendor `libqsgepaper.so` waveform engine,
  exposed as a small C ABI (`quill_init` / `quill_buffer` / `quill_swap`)
  that riddle links against with `--features takeover`. Also carries a small
  family of demos (`scribble`, a pen-to-glass latency test, plus map, image,
  and GIF renderers).

## The oracle (the "spirit" in the diary)

The diary's replies come from a vision LLM that reads your handwriting from the
committed page (sent as an inline PNG). There are **two backends**, chosen at
startup — pick whichever you have:

### Option A — any OpenAI-compatible API (easiest, zero setup)

Set an API key and riddle talks straight to an OpenAI-compatible
`/chat/completions` endpoint. Works with OpenAI, OpenRouter, Groq, a local
server — anything that speaks the format. No extra software on the tablet.

```sh
export RIDDLE_OPENAI_KEY="sk-..."                       # required
export RIDDLE_OPENAI_BASE="https://api.openai.com/v1"   # optional (default)
export RIDDLE_OPENAI_MODEL="gpt-4o-mini"                # optional; must see images
export RIDDLE_OPENAI_REASONING="low"                    # thinking models only
export RIDDLE_OPENAI_MAX_TOKENS="2000"                  # runaway guard
```

Any vision-capable model works. On the tablet these live in `oracle.env`
next to the binary (see `oracle.env.example`, or just run
`remagic config riddle` — it has one-tap presets for OpenAI, OpenRouter,
and Gemini). Example with OpenRouter:

```sh
export RIDDLE_OPENAI_KEY="$OPENROUTER_API_KEY"
export RIDDLE_OPENAI_BASE="https://openrouter.ai/api/v1"
export RIDDLE_OPENAI_MODEL="openai/gpt-4o-mini"
```

Two gotchas with thinking models (Gemini 3.x, o-series): set
`RIDDLE_OPENAI_REASONING=low` for faster first ink (some providers reject
the field on non-thinking models — leave it unset there), and keep
`RIDDLE_OPENAI_MAX_TOKENS` roomy — hidden reasoning tokens count against it,
and a tight cap starves the visible reply.

Verify your setup before launching the diary:

```sh
riddle --oracle-test path/to/handwriting.png   # prints the streamed reply
```

Measured ~0.9–1.1 s to first ink on-device. The HTTPS is built into riddle
(pure-Rust, no extra libraries).

### Option B — pi (the power path)

If you already run [`pi`](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono), riddle will use
a resident `pi --mode rpc` process kept warm (Node + your subscription auth
loaded once), so each turn pays only model latency. Used automatically when
`RIDDLE_OPENAI_KEY` is **not** set.

Both stream the reply sentence-by-sentence, so the quill starts writing seconds
before the model finishes. The persona prompt lives in `riddle/src/oracle.rs`.

## Building

Cross-compiled from x86_64. Two flavours:

### Windowed (AppLoad/qtfb) — easiest

Requires [xovi + AppLoad](https://github.com/asivery/rm-appload) on the device.

```sh
cd riddle
cargo build --release --target aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu
```

Install to `/home/root/xovi/exthome/appload/riddle/` with
`external.manifest.json`, `appload-launch.sh`, and the binary.

### Takeover (instant ink) — the one from the demo

Requires the reMarkable SDK toolchain (`~/rm-sdk-3.26`) because the linked
vendor Qt libs need its glibc, **and** `libqsgepaper.so` pulled from *your own
device* (it is proprietary and not distributed here):

```sh
cd quill && ./build.sh              # pulls libqsgepaper.so from the device over
                                    # ssh, builds libquill.so + the demos
cd ../riddle && ./build-takeover.sh
./scripts/make-bundle.sh            # stages the AppLoad bundle in dist/riddle/
```

The staged `dist/riddle/` is self-contained (binary, `libquill.so`, launch
scripts, manifest) — copy it to
`/home/root/xovi/exthome/appload/riddle/`, or publish it to the catalog with
`remagic publish dist/riddle`. Launching via AppLoad (`appload-launch.sh`)
detaches into a transient systemd unit, stops xochitl, runs the diary, and
**always restores xochitl on exit** — exit with the power button, a 5-finger
tap, or SIGTERM. If anything wedges:
`ssh root@10.11.99.1 'systemctl start xochitl'`.

## Fonts
