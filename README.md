# riddle — the diary of Tom Riddle, for the reMarkable Paper Pro

Write on the page with your pen. After a pause, the diary **drinks your ink** —
your words fade into the paper — the page thinks for a moment, and an answer
writes itself back in a flowing hand, stroke by stroke, then fades away.

No screen glow, no keyboard, no chat UI. Just ink appearing on paper.

_This is the diary from [the demo](https://x.com/MaximeRivest)._

### 🪄 New to this? Start here

You need a **reMarkable Paper Pro** in developer mode with a launcher installed.
If that sounds like a lot, it isn't — **[remagic](https://github.com/maximerivest/remagic)**
walks you through turning on developer mode and sets up everything with one
command. Come back here, drop riddle in, and start writing to Tom.

Already have xovi + AppLoad? Install from the [remagic](https://github.com/maximerivest/remagic)
catalog, [grab the prebuilt bundle](#install-the-prebuilt-bundle), or
[build from source](#building).

### Install with remagic (easiest)

```sh
remagic install riddle     # checksum-verified download → AppLoad
remagic config riddle      # settings form in your browser (+ QR for phone)
```

Then in **AppLoad**: tap **Reload**, then **The Diary**. Write, and rest your
pen. (Or install it from the **Store** app right on the tablet.)

### Install the prebuilt bundle

1. Grab `riddle-<version>.zip` from the [latest release](https://github.com/MaximeRivest/riddle/releases/latest)
   and unzip it into a folder: `unzip riddle-*.zip -d riddle`
2. Copy the folder to your tablet:
   `scp -O -r riddle root@10.11.99.1:/home/root/xovi/exthome/appload/`
3. Add an API key: `cp oracle.env.example oracle.env` in that folder and put your `RIDDLE_OPENAI_KEY` in it (any OpenAI-compatible key). Or skip it to use [pi](#option-b--pi-the-power-path).
4. In **AppLoad**: tap **Reload**, then **The Diary**. Write, and rest your pen.

> ⚠️ **This modifies your device.** The prebuilt bundle and the catalog build
> run in **takeover mode**: tapping The Diary stops the whole reMarkable UI
> and takes the screen. Leave with a **5-finger tap** — xochitl restarts
> automatically. It runs as root and drives the e-ink engine directly. It has

> OS 3.26–3.27). It may not work on other models or OS versions, and you use
> it entirely at your own risk. Not affiliated with reMarkable AS. Keep SSH

> `ssh root@10.11.99.1 'systemctl start xochitl'`.

## reMarkable 2 — SSH access and compatibility notes

The project was built and tested on the **reMarkable Paper Pro**. Running it on a
**reMarkable 2** is possible with some adjustments; this section covers the differences.

### SSH access on reMarkable 2 (simpler than Paper Pro)

Unlike the Paper Pro, the reMarkable 2 **does not require developer mode** to expose SSH
credentials — they are visible right away:

1. Open the menu (three horizontal lines, top-left corner).
2. Go to **Settings → Help → Copyrights and licenses**.
3. Scroll to the **GPLv3 Compliance** section at the bottom — your username (`root`),
   password, and IP addresses are listed there.

Connect over USB (the device always appears as `10.11.99.1` when plugged in):

```sh
ssh root@10.11.99.1
```

WLAN SSH is disabled by default. Once connected via USB, enable it with:

```sh
rm-ssh-over-wlan on
```

After that you can connect wirelessly using the WLAN IP shown in the same GPLv3 section.
To copy files to the tablet (same path as Paper Pro):

```sh
scp -O -r riddle root@10.11.99.1:/home/root/xovi/exthome/appload/
```

> 💡 **Tip:** To avoid typing the password each time, copy your SSH public key to the
> device with `ssh-copy-id root@10.11.99.1` after your first connection.

### Display backend on reMarkable 2

- **Windowed mode (AppLoad/qtfb)** — the recommended path for rM2.
  [xovi + AppLoad](https://github.com/asivery/rm-appload) supports the reMarkable 2, and
  the binary cross-compiled for `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu` matches both devices. Build
  normally with `cargo build --release --target aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu` and follow the
  standard AppLoad install.
- **Takeover mode (quill)** — depends on `libqsgepaper.so` pulled from *your own device*.
  The vendor library exists on the reMarkable 2 but targets a different board variant; the
  shim *may* work, but it has **not** been tested on rM2. Start with the windowed backend
  and switch to takeover only if you need lower latency.

> ⚠️ Hardware differences (display waveform tables, evdev event paths) between the
> reMarkable 2 and the Paper Pro may still require minor tuning. Keep SSH access live as
> your escape hatch at all times.

## How it works

```
 pen (raw evdev, full 4096-level pressure, hardware event rate)
   │ strokes
   ▼
 riddle ── idle 2.8s → commit page → PNG ──► oracle (resident LLM process,
   │                                          streams reply sentence-by-sentence)
   ▼ strokes (Dancing Script → skeletonized to single-pixel pen paths)
 display backend
   ├── qtfb        — windowed, inside xochitl (build-from-source flavour)
   └── quill       — full takeover: xochitl stopped, vendor e-ink engine
                     driven directly for instant ink (lowest latency there
                     is; what the prebuilt bundle runs)
```

- **`riddle/`** — the app (Rust). Pen input, ink surface, handwriting
  synthesis (rasterize → Zhang-Suen thinning → stroke tracing → animated
  replay), the oracle process manager, and both display backends.
- **`quill/`** — the takeover display host (C/C++). An
  [epfb-re](https://github.com/asivery/epfb-re)-style QImage-constructor
  interposition shim over the vendor `libqsgepaper.so` waveform engine,
  exposed as a small C ABI (`quill_init` / `quill_buffer` / `quill_swap`)
  that riddle links against with `--features takeover`. Also carries a small
  family of demos (`scribble`, a pen-to-glass latency test, plus map, image,
  and GIF renderers).

## Gestures

| Do this | And |
|---------|-----|
| Write, then rest the pen | The diary drinks your ink and Tom replies |
| Write *"show me what I wrote about…"* | The remembered page **rises through the paper**: the date, your own handwriting rewriting itself stroke by stroke, Tom's old reply — all in faded ink. Touch the pen anywhere and today's page returns |
| Write *"what do you remember?"* | Tom answers with a handwritten list of remembered moments |
| Flip the marker | Erase |
| Draw a large **?** | Summon the built-in guide |
| Tap five fingers at once | Leave the diary *(takeover mode)* |
| Power button | The page turns to *"The diary sleeps."*, then the tablet suspends; press again to wake exactly where you were *(takeover mode)* |

In the windowed (qtfb) flavour, xochitl keeps the touchscreen and the power
button: close the diary from AppLoad instead.

## The diary remembers

Every finished page is kept — your actual pen strokes, a transcription, and
Tom's reply — so the diary can do three things:

- **Follow the conversation.** Recent pages ride along with each request, so
  Tom remembers what you wrote yesterday (both backends, same behavior).
- **Conjure the past.** Ask in ink — *"show me the page about the garden"*,
  *"find what I wrote on Tuesday"* — and the diary rewrites that page in
  front of you, in your own hand, dated, in faded ink. No buttons, no lists,
  no chrome: the pen is the only interface.
- **Answer from memory.** *"What do you remember?"* gets a handwritten index.

Memories live only on the tablet, in plain files under
`/home/root/riddle-data/memories` (delete the folder and the diary forgets;
the last ~400 pages are kept). `RIDDLE_MEMORY=off` in `oracle.env` turns all
of it off — no storage, and nothing extra sent with requests. Set
`RIDDLE_TZ_OFFSET` (hours from UTC) so memory dates read right.

## The oracle (the "spirit" in the diary)

The diary's replies come from a vision LLM that reads your handwriting from the
committed page (sent as an inline PNG). There are **three backends**, chosen at
startup — pick whichever you have:

### Option A — any OpenAI-compatible API (easiest, zero setup)

Set an API key and riddle talks straight to an OpenAI-compatible
`/chat/completions` endpoint. Works with OpenAI, OpenRouter, Groq, a local
server — anything that speaks the format. No extra software on the tablet.

```sh
export RIDDLE_OPENAI_KEY="sk-..."                       # required
export RIDDLE_OPENAI_BASE="https://api.openai.com/v1"   # optional (default)
export RIDDLE_OPENAI_MODEL="gpt-4o-mini"                # optional; must see images
export RIDDLE_OPENAI_REASONING="low"                    # thinking models only
export RIDDLE_OPENAI_MAX_TOKENS="2000"                  # runaway guard
```

Any vision-capable model works. On the tablet these live in `oracle.env`
next to the binary (see `oracle.env.example`, or just run
`remagic config riddle` — it has one-tap presets for OpenAI, OpenRouter,
and Gemini). Example with OpenRouter:

```sh
export RIDDLE_OPENAI_KEY="$OPENROUTER_API_KEY"
export RIDDLE_OPENAI_BASE="https://openrouter.ai/api/v1"
export RIDDLE_OPENAI_MODEL="openai/gpt-4o-mini"
```

Two gotchas with thinking models (Gemini 3.x, o-series): set
`RIDDLE_OPENAI_REASONING=low` for faster first ink (some providers reject
the field on non-thinking models — leave it unset there), and keep
`RIDDLE_OPENAI_MAX_TOKENS` roomy — hidden reasoning tokens count against it,
and a tight cap starves the visible reply.

Verify your setup before launching the diary:

```sh
riddle --oracle-test path/to/handwriting.png   # prints the streamed reply
```

Measured ~0.9–1.1 s to first ink on-device. The HTTPS is built into riddle
(pure-Rust, no extra libraries).

### Option B — Ollama (local model, zero cloud)

If you have [Ollama](https://ollama.com) running on a machine reachable from
the tablet (typically a LAN server over Wi-Fi), riddle will use it with no API
key. Set at least one of:

```sh
export RIDDLE_OLLAMA_BASE="http://192.168.1.10:11434/v1"  # default: localhost:11434/v1
export RIDDLE_OLLAMA_MODEL="qwen2.5vl:7b"                 # default
```

Used automatically when `RIDDLE_OPENAI_KEY` is **not** set and at least one
`RIDDLE_OLLAMA_*` variable is present.

**Recommended models** (the model must be vision-capable — it reads each page
as a grayscale PNG):

| Model | VRAM | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `qwen2.5vl:7b` *(default)* | ~6 GB | Best handwriting OCR; follows structured instructions reliably |
| `qwen2.5vl:3b` | ~3 GB | Lighter Qwen-VL; keeps persona & OCR well, good CPU compromise |
| `llava-llama3:8b` | ~6 GB | Solid all-round alternative |
| `llava:13b` | ~10 GB | Stronger vision, slower |
| `moondream` | ~2 GB | Minimal resources; weaker OCR and instruction-following |

Pull the model on your Ollama host before starting the diary:

```sh
ollama pull qwen2.5vl:7b
```

Verify the connection from the tablet before launching:

```sh
riddle --oracle-test path/to/handwriting.png
```

No data leaves your network. `RIDDLE_OPENAI_MAX_TOKENS` is shared with
Option A and applies here too (default 2000).

**Performance on slow / CPU-only hosts.** Vision models are heavy: a 7B model
with no GPU can take a couple of minutes per reply. Two knobs help:

- `RIDDLE_ORACLE_MAX_DIM` — long side (px) of the page image sent to the
  oracle (default `800`). The page is already cropped to your ink and
  downscaled; lowering this to `640` or `512` sends fewer pixels, so the model
  answers faster, at some cost to OCR of fine handwriting.
- Pick a lighter model — `qwen2.5vl:3b` keeps Tom's persona and OCR far better
  than `moondream` while running roughly twice as fast as the 7B on CPU.

Both `ORACLE_PATIENCE` (total wait) and the oracle read timeout are 300s, so a
slow first reply won't be abandoned prematurely.

### Option C — pi (the power path)

If you already run [`pi`](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono), riddle will use
a resident `pi --mode rpc` process kept warm (Node + your subscription auth
loaded once), so each turn pays only model latency. Used automatically when
neither `RIDDLE_OPENAI_KEY` nor `RIDDLE_OLLAMA_*` is set. Defaults (override in `oracle.env`):
pi at `/home/root/node/bin` (`RIDDLE_PI_BIN_DIR`), provider `openai-codex`
(`RIDDLE_PI_PROVIDER`), model `gpt-5.4-mini` (`RIDDLE_PI_MODEL`).

All three backends stream the reply sentence-by-sentence, so the quill starts
writing seconds before the model finishes. The persona prompt lives in
`riddle/src/oracle.rs`.

A note on Tom's memory: with the HTTP and Ollama backends every page is a fresh
conversation — Tom does not remember your previous page. With pi, the warm
session remembers everything since the diary was opened (and pi persists
that session in its own data dir on the tablet).

If the oracle can't answer — missing key, refused key, no Wi-Fi, Ollama
unreachable — Tom writes the reason on the page instead of a reply, and the
full error goes to the journal (`journalctl -u riddle-takeover`).

## Building

Cross-compiled from x86_64. Two flavours:

### Windowed (AppLoad/qtfb) — build from source

The bundles above are the takeover flavour; the windowed flavour must be
built. Requires [xovi + AppLoad](https://github.com/asivery/rm-appload) on
the device.

```sh
cd riddle
cargo build --release --target aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu
```

Install the binary to `/home/root/xovi/exthome/appload/riddle/` with an
`external.manifest.json` that sets `"qtfb": true` and points `"application"`
at the binary itself (the manifest in this repo is the takeover one — AppLoad
only hands riddle a window, via `QTFB_KEY`, when `qtfb` is true).

### Takeover (instant ink) — the one from the demo

Requires the reMarkable SDK toolchain (`~/rm-sdk-3.26`) because the linked
vendor Qt libs need its glibc, **and** `libqsgepaper.so` pulled from *your own
device* (it is proprietary and not distributed here):

```sh
cd quill && ./build.sh              # pulls libqsgepaper.so from the device over
                                    # ssh, builds libquill.so + the demos
cd ../riddle && ./build-takeover.sh
./scripts/make-bundle.sh            # stages the AppLoad bundle in dist/riddle/
```

The staged `dist/riddle/` is self-contained (binary, `libquill.so`, launch
scripts, manifest) — copy it to
`/home/root/xovi/exthome/appload/riddle/`, or publish it to the catalog with
`remagic publish dist/riddle`. Launching via AppLoad (`appload-launch.sh`)
detaches into a transient systemd unit, stops xochitl, runs the diary, and
**always restores xochitl on exit** — leave with a 5-finger tap or SIGTERM
(`systemctl stop riddle-takeover`); the power button sleeps and wakes the
diary without leaving it. The unit's stop hook restarts xochitl even if
riddle dies uncleanly. If anything wedges:
`ssh root@10.11.99.1 'systemctl start xochitl'`.

## What leaves the device

- Each committed page is rasterized to a small grayscale PNG and sent to the
  oracle **you** configured — nothing else ever leaves the tablet, and there
  is no telemetry.
- The PNG (`/tmp/riddle-page.png`) is deleted as soon as the oracle has read
  it; set `RIDDLE_KEEP_PAGE=1` to keep the last page around for debugging.
- riddle never writes replies to disk. The pi backend, however, keeps its own
  session history in its data dir — the HTTP backend keeps nothing.
- Tom stays in character by design: the persona prompt (see
  `riddle/src/oracle.rs`) tells the model it is the diary and nothing else.
