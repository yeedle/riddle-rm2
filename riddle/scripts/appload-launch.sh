# transient systemd unit (PID-1-owned, survives xochitl) and exit immediately.

# Works wherever the bundle is installed: we resolve our own directory rather
# than hardcoding a path, so dropping this folder into AppLoad just works.

# ExecStopPost is the safety net the in-script trap can't be: it runs even if
# riddle is SIGKILLed or OOM-killed, so the tablet never stays UI-less.
# (`systemctl start` on an already-running xochitl is a no-op; the leading
# "-" ignores failures.) Fall back to a plain launch if the property is
# rejected by an older systemd.
